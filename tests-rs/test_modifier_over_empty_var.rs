//! A modifier over an empty-but-real variable must render nothing, not the
//! variable's own name.
//!
//! `expand_var` returned `""` both for "this is not a variable" and for "this
//! is a variable whose value is currently empty". `expand_var_or_format`
//! treated any empty result as the former and fell back to echoing the target
//! as a literal, so `#{b:pane_path}` rendered the text `pane_path` whenever the
//! shell had not yet announced a path via OSC 7.
//!
//! That made every optional variable unusable behind a modifier, and it failed
//! in the worst possible way: not blank, not an error, but plausible-looking
//! text sitting in the status bar. A bare `#{pane_path}` was always correct, so
//! the bug only surfaced once a modifier was added.
//!
//! The literal-echo fallback is deliberate tmux-ish behaviour for genuinely
//! unknown names and is kept — these tests pin the boundary between the two.
