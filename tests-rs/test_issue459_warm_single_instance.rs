// Issue #459: "psmux spawns an unbounded, continuously-growing number of
// psmux.exe processes".
//
// Every real session is protected by the single-server-per-name mutex (issue
// #2): a second server that finds the name already owned exits immediately
// instead of running as a duplicate. Warm (`__warm__`) servers were explicitly
// exempted from that guard, on the stated rationale that "the warm pool
// intentionally runs several at once".
//
// There is no pool. `spawn_warm_server` early-returns when it verifies a live
// warm, and the handoff is a SINGLE file per namespace (`__warm__.port`), so a
// namespace can only ever publish one warm server no matter how many are
// running. Everything past the first is unreachable and immortal: nothing
// attaches to it, nothing claims it, and nothing ever kills it.
//
// The only exclusion left for warm was `acquire_warm_spawn_lock`, which is
// strictly weaker than a mutex in three ways that all showed up in the field:
//
//   * it is advisory and time-boxed — held for at most ~3s while waiting for the
//     new warm's `.port` to appear, then released whether or not it ever did;
//   * it is a plain file whose `Drop` never runs when the owner is killed, so a
//     dead owner leaves a lock that is only cleared by a 20s staleness steal;
//   * it guards the check->spawn window only, so *sequential* spawns seconds
//     apart — exactly what was observed — sail straight through it.
//
// The captured evidence was a five-deep parent chain of live `server -s __warm__`
// processes in the default namespace, spawned 1-4s apart, with NO `__warm__.port`
// present at all: each one failed to register, so the next caller saw "no warm
// exists" and started another.
//
// These tests assert the guard now covers warm names, and that the guard is
// still handed off on claim so a namespace does not end up with no warm at all.
// Ownership probes run on a SPAWNED THREAD because a Windows mutex is recursive
// for its owning thread: probing from the holder would always report "free".
